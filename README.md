# Prediction under uncertainty as a boundary problem

Code for the article:

"Prediction under uncertainty as a boundary problem: A general formulation using Iterative Closed Question Modelling"

Example R implementation of Iterative Closed Question Modelling using 8 different techniques
This demonstrates the treatment of prediction under uncertainty as a boundary problem.

Quickstart:

1. Download the zip and extract the files
2. Open icqm_example.R in R's editor or Rstudio
3. Run the code. This will make use of the other files as required.
